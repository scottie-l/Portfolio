        "about": "Hello, my name is Scott Lease. I come from a wide body of work experience ranging from construction to cooking. In my previous role, I installed, maintained, and repaired X-ray machines and equipment. During this time, digital X-rays took over the industry. I had to learn how to integrate X-ray machines with the digital X-rays and some troubleshooting on the computer systems. It was at this time that I began to research and learn more about programming and that sparked my interest in developing. I took some online classes, but that only broadened my horizon of all the possibilities that are available. I now want to really level up my game to see how best I can break into the industry that I see has so much potential. I‚Äôm so excited to continue my journey and improve the lives and world through technology and my coding skills. I hope you‚Äôll join me on my journey to see how I improve the world.",
